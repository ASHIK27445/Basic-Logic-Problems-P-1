## Problems

### Problem 1: Reverse a String

Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

**Example:**
```
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"
```

**Key Concepts:** String manipulation, iteration

---

### Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String

Write a function that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string.

**Example:**
```
Input: "programming"
Output: 3
```

**Key Concepts:** String traversal, conditional logic

---

### Problem 3: Check for Palindrome

Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

**Examples:**
```
Input: "madam"
Output: true

Input: "hello"
Output: false
```

**Key Concepts:** String comparison, symmetry checking

---

### Problem 4: Find the Maximum Number

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.

**Example:**
```
Input: [5, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 9
```

**Key Concepts:** Array traversal, comparison operations

---

### Problem 5: Remove Duplicates from an Array

Write a function that removes all duplicate numbers from an array.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Key Concepts:** Data structures, uniqueness checking

---

### Problem 6: Sum of All Numbers in an Array

Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in an array.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10
```

**Key Concepts:** Array iteration, accumulation

---

### Problem 7: Find Even Numbers in an Array

Write a function that returns all even numbers from a given array.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Key Concepts:** Filtering, modulo operator

---

### Problem 8: Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

**Example:**
```
Input: "hello world"
Output: "Hello World"
```

**Key Concepts:** String manipulation, word boundaries

---

### Problem 9: Find the Factorial of a Number

Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

**Example:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 120
```

**Explanation:** 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

**Key Concepts:** Mathematical operations, loops

---

### Problem 10: PingPong Challenge

Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 20.

**Rules:**
* For multiples of 3, print "Ping"
* For multiples of 5, print "Pong"
* For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "PingPong"
* If the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the number itself

**Example Output:**
```
1, 2, Ping, 4, Pong, Ping, 7, 8, Ping, Pong, 11, Ping, 13, 14, PingPong, 16, 17, Ping, 19, Pong
```

**Key Concepts:** Conditional logic, modulo operator, classic FizzBuzz variant
